#[Videobox - a lightweight video player and gallery](https://hitko.eu/videobox)
Videobox is a MODX extension for adding video and audio to your site. It supports videos from YouTube and Vimeo, as well as music from SoundCloud, Twitch videos and streams, and HTML5 supported video and audio formats. There are many ways to insert a video player in the content, including the standard video player, a pop-up player, expanding inline player, or a gallery of videos. All you have to do is put ```[[Videobox? &videos=`XfSfK8AkGVo`]]``` and you get a beautiful responsive video player. 

###Demo
If you want to see Videobox in action, check out the [demo page](https://hitko.eu/videobox)

###Basic options
The example above uses a single YouTube video ID, but Videobox can do much more. Below is an example of the full video syntax, including start and end time, video title, and multiple videos. Check out the [Getting started guide](https://hitko.eu/videobox/getting-started/#htk-videobox-for-modx) for a detailed explanation of the syntax, and [Videobox documentation](https://hitko.eu/videobox/documentation/) for a guide on the parameters you can use.
